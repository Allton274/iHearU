A mobile app for Android that uses Continuous Speech Recognition to notify emergency contacts of a potential situation.

Works even when the phone is asleep/out of the app.

The main goal with this app is to allow users a chance to call for help without notifying an assailant of their intent. For example, if the keyword they have set is "please don't hurt me", the app would send a message to emergency contacts the user selected and notify them there might be a problem. All the while, the assailant would assume the user was talking to them.
